# Overview

Welcome to my analysis of the data job market in the SEA (South East Asia) region, focusing only on data analyst roles. This project was created to put all my Python knowledge that I have just accquired in the Python Course by Luke Barrouse into good practice as well as to understand the job market more effectively. The project delves into the top-paying and in-demand skills to help find optimal job opportunities for data analysts.

The data sourced from [Luke Barousse's Python Course](https://lukebarousse.com/python) which provides a foundation for my analysis, containing detailed information on job titles, working modes, salaries, perks, working locations, and required skills. Through a series of Python scripts, I managed to find answers for key questions such as what is the most demanded skills, what is the salary trends, and how can we identify the intersection of demand and salary in the data analytics sector.

# Key Questions

Below are the questions needed to be answered in the project:

1. What are the top 5 in-demand skills for the top 3 most popular data roles in SEA countries?
2. How are in-demand skills trending for Data Analysts in SEA countries?
3. What are the most well-paid data jobs and data skills in SEA countries?
4. What are the optimal skills for data analysts to learn? (High Demand AND High Paying) 

# Tools of Choice

For my extensive analysis into the data analyst job market in the SEA region, I harnessed the power of several key tools:

- **Python:** The backbone of the analysis process which helps to dissect the raw data and find critical insights. The following Python libraries were used:
    - **Pandas Library:** This was used to analyze the data. 
    - **Matplotlib Library:** This was used to visualize the data.
    - **Seaborn Library:** This was used for customizing advanced visuals. 
- **Jupyter Notebooks:** This tool is used to run Python scripts as well as to include notes and analysis along the way for reference purpose.
- **Visual Studio Code:** It is used for executing the Python scripts.
- **Git & GitHub:** This is an essential tool for version controling and online-sharing the Python code and analysis, enabling collaboration and changes tracking capabilities.

# Data Preparation and Cleanup

This section outlines the steps taken to prepare the data for analysis, ensuring data accuracy, integrity and usability.

## Import & Clean Up Data

Import necessary libraries and load the dataset from an online source, followed by initial data cleaning tasks to ensure data quality.

```python
# Importing Libraries
import ast
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
from datasets import load_dataset
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt  

# Loading Data
dataset = load_dataset('lukebarousse/data_jobs')
df = dataset['train'].to_pandas()

# Data Cleanup
df['job_posted_date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['job_posted_date'])
df['job_skills'] = df['job_skills'].apply(lambda x: ast.literal_eval(x) if pd.notna(x) else x)
```

## Filter Jobs in the SEA region

To extensively focus the analysis on the SEA job market, filters were applied to the dataset, narrowing down to roles based in the ASEAN countries.

```python

SEA_countries = ['Vietnam', 'Thailand','Malaysia','Philippines','Indonesia','Laos','Cambodia','Myanmar','Singapore']

df_SEA = df[df['job_country']isin(SEA_countries)] 
# SEA stands for South East Asia

```

# Data Analysis

Each Jupyter notebook for this project aimed at investigating specific aspects of the data job market in the SEA (South East Asia) region. Hereâ€™s how I approached each question:

## 1. What are the top 5 in-demand skills for the top 3 most popular data roles in SEA countries?

To find the most demanded skills for the top 3 most popular data roles. I filtered out those positions by which ones were the most popular, and got the top 5 skills for these top 3 roles. This query highlights the most popular job titles and their top skills, showing which skills I should pay attention to depending on the role I'm targeting.

### Visualize Data

```python
fig, ax = plt.subplots(len(top_titles),1)
fig.set_size_inches((7,7))
for i, job_title in enumerate(top_titles):
    df_plot = df_skills_perc[df_skills_perc['job_title_short']== job_title].head(5) # filter for top 5 skills
    sns.barplot(
        data = df_plot,
        x='skill_percent',
        y='job_skills',
        ax = ax[i],
        hue = 'skill_percent',
        palette= 'dark:g_r' # r stands for reverse -> blue and reverse 
    )
    sns.despine()
    ax[i].legend('')
    ax[i].set_title(job_title)
    ax[i].set_ylabel('')
    ax[i].set_xlabel('')
    ax[i].set_xlim(0,70)
    if i != len(top_titles)-1: # this mean that if i = 2, the below code will not be executed
        ax[i].set_xticks([])
    
    #create a loop to place data labels onto the chart
    for n,v in enumerate(df_plot['skill_percent']):
        ax[i].text(x= v+1, y= n, s=f'{v:.0f}%', va= 'center') # va stands for vertical alignment, i guess

fig.suptitle('Likelihood of Skills Requested in SEA Job Postings', fontsize = 15)
fig.tight_layout(h_pad= 2)

plt.show()
```

### Results

*Bar graph visualizing the trending top skills for data analysts in the SEA region in 2023.*

### Insights:
- `SQL` remains the most consistently demanded skill throughout the year, although it shows a gradual decrease in demand from September to November but it goes up again in the final month of 2023.
- `Excel` experienced a significant decrease in demand in the fourth quarter, it is also surpassed by Python by the end of the year.
- `Python` show relatively unstable demand throughout the year with significant fluctuations in Q2 and a demand surge in the last month. However, this skill still has a upward trend on overall and replaces `Excel` to become the second most sought-after skills in job postings.
- `Power BI`, which is less demanded compared to the other skills, shows a slight upward trend towards the year's end. Meanwhile, the demand of `Tableau` has not increased much after the year 2023.

## 3. What are the most well-paid data jobs and what are the most well-paid data skills for Data Analysts in SEA countries?

### Salary Distributions of the top 6 popular jobs in SEA countries
To identify the highest-paying roles and skills, only jobs in the SEA countries were chosen and the median salary were calculated. But first, in order to get an idea of which jobs are paid the most, the salary distributions of the most common data jobs in the SEA region will be calculated.

View my notebook with detailed steps here: [05.04 Salary_Analysis.ipynb](./05.04.%20Salary_Analysis.ipynb)

#### Visualize Data 

```python
sns.boxplot(
    data= df_SEA_top6,
    x= "salary_year_avg",
    y= "job_title_short",
    order= job_order # seaborn also has a param to organize the order of categories
)
sns.set_theme(style= 'ticks')
sns.despine()

plt.title('Salary Distributions in the SEA Region')
plt.xlabel('Yearly Salary (USD)')
plt.ylabel('')
ticks_x = plt.FuncFormatter(lambda y, pos: f'{int(y/1000)}K')
plt.gca().xaxis.set_major_formatter(ticks_x)
plt.show()

```

#### Results

![Salary Distributions of Data Jobs in SEA countries](/05.%20Capstone%20Project/images/Salary_Distributions_SEA.png)  
*Box plot visualizing the salary distributions for the top 6 data job titles across countries in the SEA region.*

#### Insights

- There's a significant variation in salary ranges across different job titles. Data Scientist positions tend to have the highest salary potential, with up to $200K annually; however, the median salary of Data Scientist positions is only the fifth highest (around $80K), indicating that only a few DS positions in SEA countries can be offered as much as 200k per year. 

- Data Analyst and Data Scientist roles show a much wider salary spectrum than others, suggesting that job seekers should be prepared for the pay disparity between different companies and different countries in those 2 roles. In contrast, Senior DA and DE roles demonstrate more consistency in salary, with a narrower range.

- The median salaries increase with the seniority and specialization of the roles. Senior roles (Senior Data Analyst, Senior Data Engineer) not only have higher median salaries but also larger differences in typical salaries, reflecting greater variance in compensation as responsibilities increase.

### Highest Paid & Most Demanded Skills for Data Analysts

Next, The analysis is narrowed down only on  Data Analyst roles. The objective of this section is to compare the highest-paid skills with the most in-demand skills, figuring out the kills that are simultaenously highly sought-after and well-paid

#### Visualize Data

```python

fig, ax = plt.subplots(2,1)

sns.barplot(
    data= df_DA_SEA_top_pay,
    x= 'median',
    y= 'job_skills',
    hue = 'median',
    palette= 'dark:b_r',
    ax= ax[0]
)

ax[0].set_xlabel('')
ax[0].set_ylabel('')
ax[0].legend('')
ax[0].set_xlim(0,170000)
ax[0].set_title('Top 10 Highest Paid Skills for Data Analysts')
ax[0].xaxis.set_major_formatter(plt.FuncFormatter(lambda x,pos: f'${int(x/1000)}K'))

sns.barplot(
    data= df_DA_SEA_pop_skills,
    x= 'median',
    y= 'job_skills',
    hue = 'median',
    palette= 'light:b',
    ax= ax[1]
)

ax[1].set_xlabel('Median Salary (USD)')
ax[1].set_ylabel('')
ax[1].legend('')
ax[1].set_xlim(0,170000)
ax[1].set_title('Top 10 Most In-Demand Skills for Data Analysts')
ax[1].xaxis.set_major_formatter(plt.FuncFormatter(lambda x,pos: f'${int(x/1000)}K'))

fig.tight_layout()

plt.show()

```

#### Results
Here's the breakdown of the highest-paid & most in-demand skills for data analysts in the US:

![The Highest Paid & Most In-Demand Skills for Data Analysts in the US](/05.%20Capstone%20Project/images/Top_Pay_vs_In_Demand.png)
*Two separate bar graphs visualizing the highest paid skills and most in-demand skills for data analysts in the US.*

#### Insights:

- The top graph shows specialized technical skills like `Golang`, `Redshift`, and `kafka` are associated with higher salaries, some reaching up to $165K, suggesting that advanced technical proficiency such as progamming languages and cloud-computing technology can increase earning potential in the SEA region.

- The bottom graph highlights that foundational skills like `Excel`, `Tableau`, `SQL` and `Looker` are the most in-demand, even though they may not offer the highest salaries. While `spark` has dominantly outnumbered in terms of median salary but the ocurrence of this skill in job postings is only 8, much lower than other skills in the graph. This demonstrates the importance of developing these fundamental core skills for landing the very first entry-level data jobs.

- Except for `spark`, there's a clear distinction between the skills that are highest paid and those that are most in-demand. Data analysts aiming to maximize their career potential should consider focusing on the core skills that are currently in demand in the earlier career stage and develop high-paying skills in the later stage based on the fact that Senior DA and Senior DE in SEA countries are the roles which are paid the most in terms of median salary in 2023.

## 4. What are the most optimal skills to learn for Data Analysts in the SEA region?

To identify the most optimal skills to learn (the ones that are the highest paid and the highly sought-after), the percent of skill demand and the median salary of these skills were calculated so as to easily identify which are the most optimal skills to learn as Data Analysts working in SEA countries. 

View my notebook with detailed steps here: [05.05 Optimal_Skills.ipynb](./05.05.%20Optimal_Skills.ipynb).

#### Visualize Data

```python
from adjustText import adjust_text
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

plt.scatter(df_DA_skills_high_demand['skill_percent'], df_DA_skills_high_demand['median_salary'])
plt.show()

```

#### Results

![Most Optimal Skills for Data Analysts in the US](/05.%20Capstone%20Project/images/Optimal_skills_no_group.png)    
*A scatter plot visualizing the most optimal skills (high paying & high demand) for data analysts in SEA countries.*

#### Insights:

- The skill `spark` appears to have the highest median salary of over $130K, despite being less common in job postings. This suggests a high value placed on specialized large-scale data analytics skills within the data analyst profession in the SEA region.

- More commonly required skills like `SQL` and `Python` have a large presence in job listings but lower median salaries compared to foundational skills like `excel` or `tableau`, which not only have higher salaries but are also moderately prevalent in job listings.

- Skills such as `power bi`, `r`, `excel`and `tableau` are towards the middle part of the salary spectrum (around $90K-$100K) while also being fairly common in job listings (above 20%), indicating that proficiency in these tools can result in the better likelihood of earning job opportunities in in the data analytics industry across SEA countries  

### Visualizing Different Techonologies

Let's visualize the different technologies as well in the graph. Color labels will be added based on the technology (e.g., {Programming: Python})

#### Visualize Data

```python
# Create the scatter plot

sns.scatterplot(
    data = df_plot,
    x = 'skill_perc',
    y= 'median_salary',
    hue = 'technology'
)
sns.despine()

# Prepare texts for adjustText
texts=[]
for i, txt in enumerate(df_plot['skills']):
    texts.append(plt.text(df_plot['skill_perc'].iloc[i],df_plot['median_salary'].iloc[i], txt))

# Adjust text to avoid overlaps
adjust_text(texts,arrowprops=dict(arrowstyle='->',color = 'red'))

# Set axis labels, title
plt.xlabel('Percent of DA jobs') 
plt.ylabel('Median Yearly Salary')
plt.title(f'Most Optimal Skills for Data Analysts in SEA countries')

# Format X&Y axes' tick values
ax = plt.gca()
ax.yaxis.set_major_formatter(plt.FuncFormatter(lambda y,pos: f'${int(y/1000)}K'))
from matplotlib.ticker import PercentFormatter
ax.xaxis.set_major_formatter(plt.FuncFormatter(lambda x,pos: f'{int(x)}%'))

plt.show()

```
