# Overview

Welcome to my analysis of the data job market in the SEA (South East Asia) region, focusing only on data analyst roles. This project was created to put all my Python knowledge that I have just accquired in the Python Course by Luke Barrouse into good practice as well as to understand the job market more effectively. The project delves into the top-paying and in-demand skills to help find optimal job opportunities for data analysts.

The data sourced from [Luke Barousse's Python Course](https://lukebarousse.com/python) which provides a foundation for my analysis, containing detailed information on job titles, working modes, salaries, perks, working locations, and required skills. Through a series of Python scripts, I managed to find answers for key questions such as what is the most demanded skills, what is the salary trends, and how can we identify the intersection of demand and salary in the data analytics sector.

# Key Questions

Below are the questions needed to be answered in the project:

1. What are the top 5 in-demand skills for the top 3 most popular data roles in SEA countries?
2. How are in-demand skills trending for Data Analysts in SEA countries?
3. What are the most well-paid data jobs and data skills in SEA countries?
4. What are the optimal skills for data analysts to learn? (High Demand AND High Paying) 

# Tools of Choice

For my extensive analysis into the data analyst job market in the SEA region, I harnessed the power of several key tools:

- **Python:** The backbone of the analysis process which helps to dissect the raw data and find critical insights. The following Python libraries were used:
    - **Pandas Library:** This was used to analyze the data. 
    - **Matplotlib Library:** This was used to visualize the data.
    - **Seaborn Library:** This was used for customizing advanced visuals. 
- **Jupyter Notebooks:** This tool is used to run Python scripts as well as to include notes and analysis along the way for reference purpose.
- **Visual Studio Code:** It is used for executing the Python scripts.
- **Git & GitHub:** This is an essential tool for version controling and online-sharing the Python code and analysis, enabling collaboration and changes tracking capabilities.

# Data Preparation and Cleanup

This section outlines the steps taken to prepare the data for analysis, ensuring data accuracy, integrity and usability.

## Import & Clean Up Data

Import necessary libraries and load the dataset from an online source, followed by initial data cleaning tasks to ensure data quality.

```python
# Importing Libraries
import ast
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
from datasets import load_dataset
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt  

# Loading Data
dataset = load_dataset('lukebarousse/data_jobs')
df = dataset['train'].to_pandas()

# Data Cleanup
df['job_posted_date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['job_posted_date'])
df['job_skills'] = df['job_skills'].apply(lambda x: ast.literal_eval(x) if pd.notna(x) else x)
```

## Filter Jobs in the SEA region

To extensively focus the analysis on the SEA job market, filters were applied to the dataset, narrowing down to roles based in the ASEAN countries.

```python

SEA_countries = ['Vietnam', 'Thailand','Malaysia','Philippines','Indonesia','Laos','Cambodia','Myanmar','Singapore']

df_SEA = df[df['job_country']isin(SEA_countries)] 
# SEA stands for South East Asia

```

# Data Analysis

Each Jupyter notebook for this project aimed at investigating specific aspects of the data job market in the SEA (South East Asia) region. Hereâ€™s how I approached each question:

## 1. What are the top 5 in-demand skills for the top 3 most popular data roles in SEA countries?

To find the most demanded skills for the top 3 most popular data roles. I filtered out those positions by which ones were the most popular, and got the top 5 skills for these top 3 roles. This query highlights the most popular job titles and their top skills, showing which skills I should pay attention to depending on the role I'm targeting.

### Visualize Data

```python
fig, ax = plt.subplots(len(top_titles),1)
fig.set_size_inches((7,7))
for i, job_title in enumerate(top_titles):
    df_plot = df_skills_perc[df_skills_perc['job_title_short']== job_title].head(5) # filter for top 5 skills
    sns.barplot(
        data = df_plot,
        x='skill_percent',
        y='job_skills',
        ax = ax[i],
        hue = 'skill_percent',
        palette= 'dark:g_r' # r stands for reverse -> blue and reverse 
    )
    sns.despine()
    ax[i].legend('')
    ax[i].set_title(job_title)
    ax[i].set_ylabel('')
    ax[i].set_xlabel('')
    ax[i].set_xlim(0,70)
    if i != len(top_titles)-1: # this mean that if i = 2, the below code will not be executed
        ax[i].set_xticks([])
    
    #create a loop to place data labels onto the chart
    for n,v in enumerate(df_plot['skill_percent']):
        ax[i].text(x= v+1, y= n, s=f'{v:.0f}%', va= 'center') # va stands for vertical alignment, i guess

fig.suptitle('Likelihood of Skills Requested in SEA Job Postings', fontsize = 15)
fig.tight_layout(h_pad= 2)

plt.show()
```

### Results

## 3. ## What are the most well-paid data jobs and data skills in SEA countries?

### Salary Distributions of the top 6 popular jobs in SEA countries
To identify the highest-paying roles and skills, I only got jobs in the SEA countries and looked at their median salary. But first I looked at the salary distributions of the most common data jobs like Data Scientist, Data Engineer, and Data Analyst, etc. to get an idea of which jobs are paid the most. 

View my notebook with detailed steps here: [05.04 Salary_Analysis.ipynb](./05.04.%20Salary_Analysis.ipynb)

#### Visualize Data 

```python
sns.boxplot(
    data= df_SEA_top6,
    x= "salary_year_avg",
    y= "job_title_short",
    order= job_order # seaborn also has a param to organize the order of categories
)
sns.set_theme(style= 'ticks')
sns.despine()

plt.title('Salary Distributions in the SEA Region')
plt.xlabel('Yearly Salary (USD)')
plt.ylabel('')
ticks_x = plt.FuncFormatter(lambda y, pos: f'{int(y/1000)}K')
plt.gca().xaxis.set_major_formatter(ticks_x)
plt.show()

```

#### Results

![Salary Distributions of Data Jobs in SEA countries](/05.%20Capstone%20Project/images/Salary_Distributions_SEA.png)  
*Box plot visualizing the salary distributions for the top 6 data job titles across countries in the SEA region.*

#### Insights

- There's a significant variation in salary ranges across different job titles. Senior Data Scientist positions tend to have the highest salary potential, with up to $600K, indicating the high value placed on advanced data skills and experience in the industry.

- Senior Data Engineer and Senior Data Scientist roles show a considerable number of outliers on the higher end of the salary spectrum, suggesting that exceptional skills or circumstances can lead to high pay in these roles. In contrast, Data Analyst roles demonstrate more consistency in salary, with fewer outliers.

- The median salaries increase with the seniority and specialization of the roles. Senior roles (Senior Data Scientist, Senior Data Engineer) not only have higher median salaries but also larger differences in typical salaries, reflecting greater variance in compensation as responsibilities increase.

### Highest Paid & Most Demanded Skills for Data Analysts

Next, I narrowed my analysis and focused only on Data Analyst roles. I looked at the highest-paid skills and the most in-demand skills. I used two bar charts to showcase these.

#### Visualize Data

```python

fig, ax = plt.subplots(2,1)

sns.barplot(
    data= df_DA_SEA_top_pay,
    x= 'median',
    y= 'job_skills',
    hue = 'median',
    palette= 'dark:b_r',
    ax= ax[0]
)

ax[0].set_xlabel('')
ax[0].set_ylabel('')
ax[0].legend('')
ax[0].set_xlim(0,170000)
ax[0].set_title('Top 10 Highest Paid Skills for Data Analysts')
ax[0].xaxis.set_major_formatter(plt.FuncFormatter(lambda x,pos: f'${int(x/1000)}K'))

sns.barplot(
    data= df_DA_SEA_pop_skills,
    x= 'median',
    y= 'job_skills',
    hue = 'median',
    palette= 'light:b',
    ax= ax[1]
)

ax[1].set_xlabel('Median Salary (USD)')
ax[1].set_ylabel('')
ax[1].legend('')
ax[1].set_xlim(0,170000)
ax[1].set_title('Top 10 Most In-Demand Skills for Data Analysts')
ax[1].xaxis.set_major_formatter(plt.FuncFormatter(lambda x,pos: f'${int(x/1000)}K'))

fig.tight_layout()

plt.show()

```

#### Results
Here's the breakdown of the highest-paid & most in-demand skills for data analysts in the US:

sns.scatterplot(
    data = df_plot,
    x = 'skill_perc',
    y= 'median_salary',
    hue = 'technology'
)
sns.despine()

# Prepare texts for adjustText
texts=[]
for i, txt in enumerate(df_plot['skills']):
    texts.append(plt.text(df_plot['skill_perc'].iloc[i],df_plot['median_salary'].iloc[i], txt))

# Adjust text to avoid overlaps
adjust_text(texts,arrowprops=dict(arrowstyle='->',color = 'red'))

# Set axis labels, title
plt.xlabel('Percent of DA jobs') 
plt.ylabel('Median Yearly Salary')
plt.title(f'Most Optimal Skills for Data Analysts in SEA countries')

# Format X&Y axes' tick values
ax = plt.gca()
ax.yaxis.set_major_formatter(plt.FuncFormatter(lambda y,pos: f'${int(y/1000)}K'))
from matplotlib.ticker import PercentFormatter
ax.xaxis.set_major_formatter(plt.FuncFormatter(lambda x,pos: f'{int(x)}%'))

plt.show()
